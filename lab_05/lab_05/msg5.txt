Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations 
in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. 
These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, 
Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the 
Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as 
astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of 
calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.
