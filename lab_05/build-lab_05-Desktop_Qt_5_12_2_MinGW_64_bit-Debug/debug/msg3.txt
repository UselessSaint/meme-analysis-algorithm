In ancient Greece and Rome, the phoenix was sometimes associated with the similar-sounding Phoenicia, 
a civilization famous for its production of purple dye from conch shells.
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a halo, 
which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.
